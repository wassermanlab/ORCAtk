OrcaTK Libraries
================
The OrcaTK package now incorporate the following previously separate libraries:
ConservationAnalysis
PhastConsAnalysis
Orca (now renamed Aligner)

Installation
============
To install the OrcaTK modules in the standard Perl lib tree:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Dependencies
============
You must have at least version 1.2 of BioPerl as well as bioperl-run.

You must have NCBI BLAST installed on your machine and the bl2seq executable
must be somewhere in your path on order to run the ORCA aligner.

You must have at least version 0.5.0 of the TFBS Perl modules for
transcription factor binding site detection and analysis installed. Available
from http://tfbs.genereg.net.

You must have the DBI and DBD::mysql perl modules to connect to the JASPAR
database of transcription factor binding sites in order to perform the TFBS
analysis.

If you use the software to produce graphical output you must install the GD.pm
module.

Please note that graphical output also requires my_xyplot.pm which is in
OrcaTK/lib/Bio. You may need to install this in the standard Bioperl library
tree under Bio/Graphics/Glyph/my_xyplot.pm.

You may also have to make and install the align_cons and nwalign C programs
separately:

cd OrcaTK/bin/align_cons
make
make install

cd OrcaTK/bin/nwalign
make
make install

The make install puts the executables in /usr/local/bin but you may want to
skip the install step and optionally copy them to somewhere else in your path.
