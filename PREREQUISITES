ORCAtk Prerequisites
--------------------

The following software and databases are required by ORCAtk.

1) The bioperl library

   The bioperl library available at:
   	http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Getting_BioPerl

   At least version 1.4 is required.

2) The TFBS perl library

   This is available at:
   	http://tfbs.genereg.net

3) Perl modules

   The folowing perl modules must be installed:
	CGI
   	CGI::Application
	DBI
	DBD::MySQL
	GD

   These should all be available through cpan.

4) hgWiggle program

   This program is part of the Jim Kent (UCSC) source tree which may be
   downloaded directly from:
   	http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/jksrc.zip

   For general information on downloading and using the UCSC source and data
   see:
   	http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html

   You only need to compile the hgWiggle program but it may be easier to
   compile the entire source tree. After compiling hgWiggle you need to place
   it somewhere in your path, e.g. /usr/local/bin.

5) UCSC species databases

   For each of the species DBs, ORCAtk only requires the phastCons table.
   It is not necessary to recreate the entire UCSC database for each species,
   e.g. for human genome assembly GRCh37, create a DB called hg19 containing
   the phastCons46wayPlacental table. The Wasserman lab version of ORCAtk
   currently only supports multi-species (phastCons) analysis for human and
   mouse (hg19 and mm9) but you can follow the same process to enable
   multi-species analysis for whichever species you wish, as long as it has
   phastCons data at UCSC.

   e.g., for the human hg19 (placental mammals) phastCons table data, ftp to:
   	hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database

   Download the files phastCons46wayPlacental.sql (table definition) and
   phastCons46wayPlacental.txt.gz (table data). Create a MySQL database
   called hg19 and create and populate the phastCons46wayPlacental table
   using the definition/data files above.

   Alternatively you may download these databases from the Wasserman lab
   (see below).
   
   The phastCons table indexes data contained in a flat file, so you need to
   download this file to a local directory. Again for the human hg19 data
   the file required is:
   	/gbdb/hg19/multiz46way/phastCons46wayPlacental.wib

   Now you have to make sure that the path referred to in "file" field of
   the phastCons DB table matches the path to the local wib file. Either
   do a global replace on the contents of the "file" field or set up symbolic
   links to the local file to match the path in the DB table, e.g.

6) Ensembl species (core) databases

   The versions used should match the version of the API installed below in
   step 8. It is possible to just link to the ones hosted at the Sanger
   Institute or the Wasserman lab (see below) but this may be slow.
   
   To download and install your own local copies, ftp to:
	ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-##/mysql/
   where ## is the Ensembl version number of the database (and corresponding
   API).

   Alternatively you may download these databases from the Wasserman lab
   (see below).

   Install databases for whichever species you want to support in your
   installation of ORCAtk.

   IMPORTANT: You must make sure that the assembly used in the Ensembl database
   matches the assembly in the UCSC database, e.g. Ensembl's
   homo_sapiens_core_61_37f DB and UCSC's hg19 are both based on the GRCh37
   human genome assembly.

7) Ensembl compara database

   ORCAtk uses some of the tables in the Ensembl compara database for mapping
   orthologous genes. The compara database is available in the same location
   as the Ensembl core databases above.

   This is quite a large database and only a few tables are needed. Minimally
   you need the following tables: genome_db, homology, homology_member, member,
   meta, method_link, method_link_species_set and species_set.

8) Ensembl perl API

   The API and installation instructions are available at:
	http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/api_installation.html

   The version of the API used should match the version of the Ensembl core and
   compara databases used in steps 6 and 7 above.

9) The JASPAR DB of transcription factor binding site profiles is required by
   ORCAtk. This may be downloaded from the Wasserman lab (see section below).

10) Access to a DB called "ensembl_databases". This is required to map the
   species names to the appropriate Ensembl DB. It may be downloaded from the
   Wasserman lab (see secton below).


Accessing/Downloading Wasserman Lab Databases
---------------------------------------------
It is possible to the various databases required directly from the Wasserman
lab DB servers. All databases have a "read-only" (i.e. select privilege) user
which does not require a password. You may use the mysqldump facility to dump
the databases to you local machine for creating your one local DBs.

The Ensembl core and compara databases as well as the "ensembl_databases" DB
are all hosted on the server vm2.cmmt.ubc.ca and can be accessed via user
called "ensembl_r".

All other databases are hosted on vm5.cmmt.ubc.ca. The specific DBs required
and the MySQL user are:

DB		User
--------------	------
JASPAR_2010	jaspar_r
hg19, mm8 etc.	ucsc_r		(UCSC databases for phastCons)
