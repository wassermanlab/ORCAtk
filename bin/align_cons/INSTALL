Building and installing align_cons executable.

To build and install, use the following:
	make
	make install

The default installation directory is /usr/local/bin. Root access is generally
required to install there. Edit the BINDIR variable in the Makefile to change
the installation directory. Alternatively, the program can be built and copied
to whichever directory required. In order for this program to work correctly
with the ConservationAnalysis modules it needs to be installed in a directory
which is in your PATH.
