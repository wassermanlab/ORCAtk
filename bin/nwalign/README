nwalign
-------
	Find best global alignment between two DNA nucleotide sequences using
	the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm as modified by Gotoh [1982] and with
	the extra addition of a gap extension penalty parameter.

Usage:
	nwalign [sequence1 sequence2] | [infile]  match_score mismatch_score
		gap_penalty gap_ext_penalty outfile

	where:
		sequence1,
		sequence2 	= the two nucleotide sequences to be aligned as
				  strings
		infile		= name of file containing two nucleotide
				  sequences to be aligned in either FastA
				  or plain text (space separated) format
		match_score	= score applied additively when corresponding
				  nucleotides within the two sequences match
		mismatch_score	= score applied additively when corresponding
				  nucleotides within the two sequences do not
				  match
		gap_penalty	= score applied subtractively when a gap must 
				  be opened to improve alignment between the
				  two sequences
		gap_ext_penalty	= score applied subtractively when an existing
				  gap must be extended to improve alignment
				  between the two sequences
		outfile		= name of output file to which alignment is
				  written

Examples:
	Align two short sequences with a match score of 3, a mis-match score
	of -1, a gap open penalty of 5 and a gap extension penalty of 1.
	Store the result in the file nwalign.out.

	    nwalign ACTGCA CTGGA 3 -1 5 1 nwalign.out

	Align two sequences contained in the fasta file seqs.fa with a match
	score of 3, a mis-match score of -1, a gap open penalty of 20 and a
	gap extension penalty of 0. Store the result in the file nwalign.out.

	    nwalign seqs.fa 3 -1 20 0 nwalign.out

Output:
	The alignment is written to the file specified by outfile. The format
	is a simplified ClustalW-like format consisting of the two aligned
	sequences and the homology without headers of labelling.
	i.e.:
	GCTACTGCATTAGTATCTATGCTACTGAGTGCCCATTGATGGCTAGGTAG
	GCTA-------------TAGGCTA-------GCTATTGATG---------
	****             ** ****        * *******         

	CATCTAGCT-----AGCGATGCTAGCTGGGTCTGAGTGCTAGTGCTG
	---CGAGCTGATCGAGCGACTGTAG-TCAGTCT-AGT-CTAGTCAGC
	   * ****     *****   *** *  **** *** *****    

NOTES:
	The maximum allowable size in bytes of the NW matrix is contained in
	the header file matrix.h. Modify this value for your particular
	installation.

 	All non-ACTGactg, characters (ie masking characters) are scored as an
	automatic mismatch.

	The program only performs a one-way alignment; one of the sequences
	must be reverse complemented if this is desired.

BUGS:
	The separate gap open / gap extension penalty are not implemented
	correctly. Using the same gap open and gap extension penalty is
	equivalent to using a linear gap penalty which works correctly.
	However, using different values for gap open and gap extension penalty
	will still produce an alignment but it may not be optimal.
